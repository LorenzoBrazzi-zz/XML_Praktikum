Testing

We tested our implementations by simulating specific requests and test urls that were defined in 
the controller module. Through this, we could simply then insert the test url command in our browsers
to see which results were yielded. In case of errors, the baseX compiler, most of the time, provided a
convenient error message with the corresponding errorneos lines.

Before we fully implemented our GUI, we either tested by simply returning  xml documents, which we then
checked on their correctness regarding the expected behavior, or simply looked at the current state of the DB.

Throughout this project, we made use of the classical software testing phases. I.e. we first did test the individual 
functionality of the modules (unit testing), then tried to integrate them to other components in our system to see
if they do not alter their behavior. Finally, after integrating, we always tested the system as a whole by trying to
simulate a round of BJ until the next error shows itself, or to fully check if all changes work according to our
expectations.
